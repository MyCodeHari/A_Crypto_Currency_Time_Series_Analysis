**Analytical Outcomes
1. Trend Identification
Moving Averages: Crossovers between SMA50 and SMA200 indicate potential bullish/bearish trends.

Volatility: Spikes suggest market uncertainty or significant events (e.g., regulatory news).

2. Model Performance
Predicted vs Actual Plot: Shows how closely the model tracks real prices. Gaps indicate prediction errors.

Future Forecast: Provides directional insights but lacks confidence intervals (deterministic predictions).

3. Risk Assessment
Anomalies: Highlight extreme price movements (e.g., flash crashes or rallies).

Volatility: Helps users assess investment risk (higher volatility = higher risk).



This application provides a comprehensive toolkit for cryptocurrency investors to analyze historical trends, validate model accuracy, and forecast future prices. 
While it offers valuable insights, users should supplement results with fundamental analysis and market news. 
Enhancements like model retraining and interactive charts could further elevate its utility.**
